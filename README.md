# Portfolio

This project contains a small developer portfolio website. It is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and uses [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for scroll based animations.

## Installation

Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Previewing Locally

After installing dependencies you can serve the site locally. From the project root run:

```bash
npx http-server
```

Then open the printed address in your browser to view the portfolio.

## Customizing GSAP Animations

Animations are defined in [`animation.js`](animation.js). You can tweak the `gsap.from` options or add your own timelines and ScrollTrigger settings to change how elements animate into view.
